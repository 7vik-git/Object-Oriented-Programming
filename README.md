# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 1. Classes & Objects

* **Class:** Blueprint defining attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
* **Object:** Instance of a class representing real-world entities.

## 2. Encapsulation & Abstraction

* **Encapsulation:** Hiding internal data using private fields and providing access via getters/setters to protect object integrity.
* **Abstraction:** Hiding complex details and showing only essential features. Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
* **Interfaces:** Define method contracts without implementation, enabling abstraction and flexible design.

## 3. Inheritance

* Mechanism where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a superclass, promoting code reuse and enabling polymorphism.

## 4. Constructors

* Special methods to initialize new objects, supporting default and parameterized versions.

## 5. Object-Oriented Design Principles (OODP)

* Guidelines like Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion to create maintainable and extensible code.

## 6. `static` and `final`

* **static:** Class-level variables or methods shared by all objects.
* **final:** Used to declare constants or prevent overriding/inheritance.
